# Folio - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Folio is designed as a unified management platform that serves as the data management foundation across all verticals in the HIM ecosystem. This document outlines the architectural decisions, patterns, and principles that guide the platform's development.

## Frontend Architecture

### React with TypeScript

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, providing a component-based architecture with strong typing for improved developer experience and code quality. Key aspects include:

- **Component-Based Development**: Breaking UI into reusable, composable components
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strong typing to catch errors at compile time
- **Hooks Pattern**: Functional components with React hooks for state and side effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across all devices

### UI Framework: shadcn/ui

We leverage shadcn/ui, a collection of reusable components built on Radix UI primitives:

- **Accessible Components**: All UI elements follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
- **Customizable Design System**: Tailwind CSS integration for consistent styling
- **Headless Architecture**: Separation of styling and functionality for maximum flexibility
- **Comprehensive Component Library**: Buttons, forms, dialogs, and other UI elements

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling with several advantages:

- **Consistency**: Predefined design tokens ensure consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Performance**: Only includes CSS that's actually used in the application
- **Responsiveness**: Built-in utilities for responsive design
- **Dark Mode Support**: Easy implementation of light and dark themes

## Data Flow and State Management

### State Management Approach

Folio uses a hybrid state management approach:

- **Local Component State**: React's useState for component-specific state
- **Context API**: For sharing state between related components
- **React Query**: For server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating and reusing stateful logic

### Data Flow Patterns

The application follows these data flow patterns:

1. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State flows down from parent to child components
2. **Event Handlers**: UI interactions trigger events that update state
3. **Async Operations**: API calls and data mutations handled primarily through React Query
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background synchronization for a responsive feel

## API Integration with Supabase

### Supabase as Backend Service

Supabase provides a comprehensive backend solution with:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust, relational data storage
- **Authentication**: User management with various auth providers
- **Storage**: File storage for documents and assets
- **Realtime**: Live data updates for collaborative features
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for custom backend logic

### Integration Approach

The frontend connects to Supabase through:

- **Supabase Client**: Direct connection to the Supabase API
- **Custom Hooks**: Wrapping Supabase functionality in reusable React hooks
- **TypeScript Types**: Generated database types for type-safe queries
- **Row-Level Security**: Fine-grained access control at the database level

## AI Capabilities Integration

Folio leverages AI for several key features:

- **OpenAI/Claude Integration**: API connections to powerful language models
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions that securely call AI services
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: AI features that understand user context
- **Document Analysis**: Intelligence applied to uploaded documents
- **Code Generation**: AI assistance for technical asset management
- **Content Summarization**: Automated meeting notes and document summaries

## Component Design Principles

### Atomic Design Methodology

Components are organized following atomic design principles:

1. **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons)
2. **Molecules**: Simple component combinations (search bars, menu items)
3. **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (navigation bars, data tables)
4. **Templates**: Page layouts without specific content
5. **Pages**: Complete screens with actual content

### Component Guidelines

All components adhere to these guidelines:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing well
- **Composability**: Components can be combined in various ways
- **Props Interface**: Clear, well-documented props with TypeScript
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
- **Testing**: Unit tests for component behavior

## File and Folder Organization

The project follows a feature-based organization with clear separation of concerns:

```

├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/            # Base UI components (shadcn/ui)
│   ├── layout/        # Layout components (Sidebar, Header)
│   └── [feature]/     # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   ├── use-global-search.ts
│   ├── use-mobile.ts
│   └── use-toast.ts

│   └── Dashboard.tsx  # Main dashboard
└── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
    └── navigation.ts  # Navigation-related types
```

## Cross-Vertical Integration

### Folio as Data Management Foundation

Folio serves as the central data hub across all HIM verticals with:

- **Unified Data Model**: Consistent data structure across all applications
- **Cross-Vertical Relationships**: Data connections between different product lines
- **Shared Authentication**: Single sign-on across the ecosystem
- **Centralized Permissions**: Role-based access control for all verticals

### Vertical-Specific Support

While providing a unified foundation, Folio also supports the unique needs of each vertical:

- **Customizable Dashboards**: Tailored views for different business areas
- **Extensible Data Model**: Ability to add vertical-specific fields and relationships
- **Integration Points**: Well-defined APIs for vertical-specific applications
- **Workspace Isolation**: Clear separation between different product teams' data

## Future Architecture Considerations

As Folio evolves, several architectural enhancements are planned:

- **Microservices Evolution**: Breaking monolithic functions into specialized services
- **Advanced Caching**: Implementing more sophisticated caching strategies
- **GraphQL API Layer**: Adding a GraphQL layer for more efficient data fetching
- **Offline Support**: Progressive web app capabilities for offline functionality
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Enhanced WebSocket integration for collaborative features

This architecture provides a solid foundation for Folio while allowing for growth and adaptation as the platform and HIM's business needs evolve.
