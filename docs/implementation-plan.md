# Folio Implementation Plan

## Database Implementation Strategy

### Supabase Remote Database
- We will use the remote Supabase database as our primary database
- All database migrations will be applied through the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
- This approach provides several advantages:
  - Consistent environment across all developers
  - Built-in backup and recovery capabilities
  - Simplified deployment process
  - No need for local database setup

### Migration Process
1. **Migration Development**
   - Create migration files in the `migrations/` directory
   - Follow naming convention: `YYYYMMDD_descriptive_name.sql`
   - Include comprehensive comments and documentation
   - Test migrations locally using Supabase CLI (optional)

2. **Migration Application**
   - Apply migrations through Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
   - Execute migrations in order based on timestamp
   - Verify successful application of each migration
   - Document any manual steps or considerations

3. **Verification**
   - Use verification scripts to ensure migrations were applied correctly
   - Test database functions and triggers
   - Validate RLS policies
   - Check indexes and constraints

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Service role key for administrative operations
- Regular security audits and policy reviews
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Database Setup
1. Create utility functions
2. Implement user management tables
3. Set up authentication and authorization
4. Configure RLS policies

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation
1. Asset management tables
2. Document storage integration
3. Task management system
4. Analytics and reporting

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Frontend integration
2. API endpoint development
3. End-to-end testing
4. Performance optimization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep migrations atomic and focused
- Include rollback procedures where applicable
- Document all database changes
- Maintain version control for migrations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for database functions
- Integration tests for RLS policies
- Performance testing for critical queries
- Security testing for access controls

### Documentation
- Update schema documentation after each migration
- Document any manual steps required
- Maintain a changelog of database changes
- Keep API documentation current

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor database performance
- Review and optimize queries
- Update security policies as needed
- Maintain backup procedures

### Emergency Procedures
- Database rollback procedures
- Incident response plan
- Communication protocols
- Recovery testing schedule

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- All migrations apply successfully
- RLS policies work as expected
- Performance meets requirements
- Security requirements satisfied

### Business Requirements
- Data integrity maintained
- Access controls properly enforced
- System remains responsive
- Backup and recovery verified
