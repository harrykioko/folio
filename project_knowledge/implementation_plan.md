# Folio Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Folio project, a unified management platform designed for internal team use. The plan is structured to ensure systematic development while maintaining existing functionality and data integrity.

## Implementation Phases

## Implementation Strategy

### Database Migration Approach
```sql
-- Example migration structure
BEGIN;

-- Create new tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their projects"
ON public.projects FOR SELECT
USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
        SELECT user_id FROM public.project_members
        WHERE project_id = id
    )
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_created_by ON public.projects(created_by);

COMMIT;
```

### Feature Implementation Order
1. Start with core tables that other features depend on
2. Implement basic CRUD operations first
3. Add advanced features incrementally
4. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for database functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Performance testing for database queries

### Deployment Strategy
1. Test migrations on local Supabase instance
2. Create backup before applying to production
3. Apply migrations in small, manageable chunks
4. Monitor for any issues during deployment

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. Data migration issues
2. Performance degradation during migration
3. Integration conflicts with existing features
4. Security vulnerabilities during transition

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive testing before deployment
2. Staged rollout approach
3. Regular backups and rollback plans
4. Security audits at each phase

## Success Criteria
1. All database migrations completed successfully
2. All features implemented according to specifications
3. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
4. Security requirements fully satisfied
5. User acceptance testing completed successfully
